# Introduction to Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Let's explore some key concepts of functional programming.

## What is Functional Programming?

Functional programming is based on a few core principles:

1. Immutability
2. Pure functions
3. First-class and higher-order functions
4. Recursion

## Key Concepts

### Immutability

In functional programming, data is immutable. Once a value is created, it cannot be changed. This leads to more predictable code and makes it easier to reason about program behavior.

### Pure Functions

Pure functions are functions that:

1. Always produce the same output for the same input
2. Have no side effects

Here's an example of a pure function in JavaScript:

::: tip
Pure functions are easier to test and debug because they don't depend on external state.
::: end

### First-class and Higher-order Functions

In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens. This means they can be:

- Assigned to variables
- Passed as arguments to other functions
- Returned from functions

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them.

### Recursion

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's often used in functional programming instead of loops.

## Benefits of Functional Programming

- [ ] Improved code readability
- [x] Easier debugging and testing
- [x] Better support for parallel/concurrent programming
- [ ] Reduced complexity in some scenarios
