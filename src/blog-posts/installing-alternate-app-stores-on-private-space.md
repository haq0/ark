# Installing Alternate App Stores on Android 15 Private Space


Android 15's Private Space feature offers enhanced privacy and security for users. If you were like me, you might want to install alternate app stores within your Private Space to access a wider range of apps while maintaining privacy and security.

## Steps:

1. **Create a New Private Space**
   Start by setting up a new Private Space on your Android 15 device.

2. **Open Web Browser**
   Within your Private Space, open the web browser. For GrapheneOS users, this would be Vanadium.

3. **Enable App Installations**
   You can do this directly in the settings, or by trying to install an app.

   **And then, enable the option to install apps from unknown sources.**

4. **Install Alternate App Store**
   Download and install your preferred alternate app store, such as F-Droid or Aurora Store.

By following these steps, you can safely install and use alternate app stores within your Private Space, maintaining an additional layer of privacy and security for your apps and data.

::: warning
Remember to exercise caution when installing apps from alternate sources and always verify the authenticity of the app stores you use.
